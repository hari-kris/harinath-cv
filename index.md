### Summary
I'm an engineer who had a passion for big data and the scalable system turned Product Manager, managing Enterprise AI SaaS products for three years.

I have worked with start-ups and fortune 500 companies, building and managing platform products, and developer tools for nearly seven years.

Previous to my PM experience, I was a full-stack product engineer, data intensive system, building dev tools, machine learning models, and UI components for four years.

Since I'm an Engineer turned PM, I naturally earned the technical expertise required for a technical Product Manager. I honed my other skills all these years, such as Market and competitive research, prioritization, Product Discovery, Roadmapping, Product Metrics, Interpersonal, strategic thinking, and management skills.
